IMPORTANT DEPENDENCIES ARE INSTALLED THROUGH THE DEPENDENCY LIST
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO SPLIT THE CLI INTO A SEPARATE WAY OF USAGE
AS IT REQUIRE MANY DEPENDENCIES THAT I DON'T WANNA ADD THROUGH EACH PROJECT, THE CLI SHOULD BE USED WITH YARN DLX

// UPDATE:
TAR AND @GOATJS/DOWNLOAD ARE ONLY USED BY THE CLI, THAT'S WHY WE HAVE
TO SPLIT IT, ACTUALLY THEY'RE NOT INCLUDED ON THE PEERS AND CAN CAUSE ISSUE WHEN USING THIS PACKAGE.
